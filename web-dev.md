### Vim (super hardcore tool to learn and optional)

Vim is a text editor that has its own "language" which allows you to efficiently and precisely edit code or any text. 

It is not essential to learn, but it is useful to know the basics because it is a text editor that can be found on most systems (except Windows systems). 

On OSX and Linux systems running `vim` in the terminal will get you into Vim - if you are on Windows you can [install Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php#pc). Also check out [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) for a game that shows your how to use Vim's keybindings.

In any case, just remember, if you are ever stuck in Vim: typing `:q` to quit will get you back to the terminal.
